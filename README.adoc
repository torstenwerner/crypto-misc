= Various crypto stuff

This project implements:

* an ASN.1 parser,
* a timestamp verifier,
* an evidence record parser, and
* an evidence record verifier.

Everything is pretty low level.
Sorry for that.
This parser has some advantages over other ASN.1 parsers.

- ASN.1 often contain other ASN.1 substructures like members of a list or even a string consisting of ASN.1 octets.
This parser tries hard to descend into such potential ASN.1 substructures and parses them as well.
- It ships a file `oid.properties` that provides human readable values for various oid keys. Do you have an ASN.1 file
that is not fully covered by this property file? Just add your missing properties and their human readable messages.
You have just created an even better ASN.1 parser!

How to use it:

== Searching a (e.g. timestamp) certificate by issuer DN and serial number

The following command might be useful in Germany.
Imaging you have a time stamp signature but not the certificate from the signer but this tool needs the certificate
to check the signature.
The time stamp contains the certificate issuers dn (distinguished name) and the certificate's serial number.
Both values can be used the fetch the actual certificate from the ca (certificate authority).
